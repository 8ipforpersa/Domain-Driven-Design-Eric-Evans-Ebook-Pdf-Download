 Domain Driven Design: A Practical Guide for Software Developers  
Domain driven design (DDD) is a software development approach that focuses on the core domain and domain logic of a system, rather than the technical details or infrastructure. DDD aims to tackle the complexity and challenges of large-scale and evolving software projects by creating a common language and understanding between developers and domain experts, and by applying effective design patterns and principles.
  
The term domain driven design was coined by Eric Evans, a software engineer and consultant, in his book Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software. The book, published in 2003, is considered a classic and influential work in the field of software design. It provides a comprehensive and systematic introduction to the concepts, techniques, and best practices of DDD. It also includes many examples and case studies from real-world projects.
